    faqItemInfo1: 'No, Crypto Card is a prepaid debit card with a fixed amount and does not support overdraft limits.',
    faqItemTitle2: 'What types of currencies and networks are supported for recharging?',
    faqItemInfo2: 'At this stage, we support USDT, USDC, BTC, ETH, and platform coins for recharging. Supported networks include Trc20, Bep20, Erc20, Sol, and Bitcoin.',
    faqItemTitle3: 'What fiat currencies and countries are supported for spending with Crypto Card?',
    faqItemInfo3: 'The Crypto Card currency is USD and supports online payments worldwide.',
    faqItemTitle5: 'Is there a limit on the amount?',
    faqItemInfo5: 'There is a monthly recharge limit. For the Lite Card it is 100 USD, while the Standard Card is 2000 USD.',
    faqItemTitle5_1: 'The jurisdictions to block Crypto Card service usage.',
    faqItemInfo5_1:
      "Alchemy Pay does not provide the Crypto Card service to any person or entity in any cryptocurrency-unfriendly country in the present and future. This means that any individual or entity from these countries will be prohibited from using Alchemy Pay's Crypto Card service. The following countries are crypto-unfriendly countries: Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China (People's Republic of China), Ecuador, Macedonia, and Nepal.",
    faqItemTitle6: 'How do I view the billing address for my Crypto Card?',
    faqItemInfo6: 'Click "Card Info" on the card management homepage to obtain the CVV and billing address information.',
    faqItemTitle7: 'Can Lite Card be upgraded to Standard Card?',
    faqItemInfo7: 'Currently, it is not supported but will be provided in the next version. If you already have a Lite version card and want to increase the limit, you can cancel the Lite card and reapply for the Standard card.',
    faqItemTitle8: 'What should I do if I recharge the wrong currency or network?',
    faqItemInfo8: 'Since we are dealing with financial institutions, please do not attempt such tests as it may not be recoverable. Please make sure to select the correct currency and network when recharging.',
    faqItemTitle9: 'Why is the actual recharge balance different from the set amount?',
    faqItemInfo9:
      "After ACH receives the user's payment, it will sell it in real-time for USDT, deduct the relevant fees, and recharge it to the Crypto card at a 1:1 ratio. If the currency selected by the user fluctuates greatly or the payment process takes a long time, the actual recharge amount may be slightly lower or higher than the set recharge amount.",
    faqItemInfo9_1: 'If the cryptocurrency price fluctuates greatly and the actual recharge amount is less than 5 USD, the recharge order will fail, and the user will be notified by email to initiate a refund process.',
    faqItemTitle10: 'Can the balance on the card be withdrawn?',
    faqItemInfo10: 'Yes, we support the withdrawal of the card balance to USDT.',
    faqItemTitle11: 'How long does it take to recharge?',
    faqItemInfo11: 'The recharge time depends on the network you have selected and the network conditions. Typically, recharge times range from 5 minutes to 1 hour.',
    faqItemInfo11_1: 'If your recharge takes a long time and has not yet been credited, please send your registered email, recharge address, and hash to the staff for further inquiry.',
    faqItemTitle12: 'How long does it take for a refund of a payment?',
    faqItemInfo12: 'Refunds involve international settlement and take 3-7 working days to process.',
    faqItemInfo12_1: 'Please avoid malicious refunds. If a refund is determined to be malicious, the bank and compliance parties will take certain restrictive measures against the card.',
    faqItemTitle13: 'What should I do if the payment status is always pending?',
    faqItemInfo13: `If the payment status is "pending" in the transaction record, it may be due to clearing time issues and does not mean that the transaction has failed. It is only in the processing state. Transactions of overseas Crypto cards are not settled in real-time like domestic ones and generally have a clearing period of about 24-48 hours, which may be longer in extremely special cases.`,
